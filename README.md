 Before starting university, I wanted to practice with React Native and create something both useful and practical. So, I developed an app that helps users train their typing speed, whether on a computer or a phone.<br><br>
Anyone who types a lotâ€”programmers, writers, studentsâ€”knows that when you start typing cold, your fingers feel slow, and it takes a few minutes to warm up. This app solves that problem by allowing you to improve your typing speed, reaction time, and overall fluency.
The app evaluates key metrics like typing accuracy and speed, measured in words per minute (WPM).And thatâ€™s why I called it Words per Minuteâ€”very original, I know! ðŸ˜… <br>
 Your progress is tracked through detailed charts, so you can monitor improvements and identify areas to work on.<br><br>
This wasnâ€™t just a technical experiment, but also a demonstration project to test and deepen my knowledge of React Native, learning how to build smooth interfaces and optimize performance on mobile devices.<br><br>
There are <strong>two modes</strong> in the app:
    <ul>
      <li><p id="story_text"><strong>Free Mode</strong>:  A relaxed training mode where you can practice typing without worrying about scores or tracking. Just warm up your fingers and get comfortable.</p></li>
      <li><p id="story_text"><strong>WPM Test</strong>:  A structured test designed to measure your <strong>typing speed (words per minute)</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong>. This mode tracks your performance over time, helping you see improvements and set new goals.
      You have 1 minute to write all the words that appears on the screen.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Originally, this app was designed to run not only on mobile devices but also on desktop computers, where it makes even more sense. The goal was to develop it as a web app, allowing users to practice typing directly from their keyboards without the need to install anything.<br>
    
By leveraging React Native for Web, I ensured the app could smoothly adapt to different platforms while maintaining a consistent experience. This cross-platform approach demonstrated how React Native can be used beyond mobile development, making it a powerful tool for building versatile applications.
